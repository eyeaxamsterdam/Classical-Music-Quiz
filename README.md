# QuizApp1st
I have a background in classical music. Aside from playing music, I love the history of music. In fact I rarely play classical music anymore, but I still devour books about music history.

This Quiz was built using HTML, CSS, and the JavaScript library jQuerry. Although this could be built with React Router in a much more practical way with similar or better results, I think it's a good exercise to strip back the code to see at its fundamental level what the JavaScript is actually doing. 

Every question is conditionally rendered, and every response to an answer or finished quiz is conditionally rendered as well.

Zum größten Komponisten Beethoven! - To the greatest composer Bethoven!
